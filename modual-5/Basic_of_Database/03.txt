Q.3) What is Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?

DBMS stands for Database Management System, and RDBMS is the acronym for the Relational Database Management system. In DBMS, the data is stored as a file, whereas in RDBMS, data is stored in the form of tables.


Why is DBMS Required?

Database management system, as the name suggests, is a management system that is used to manage the entire flow of data, i.e, the insertion of data or the retrieval of data, how the data is inserted into the database, or how fast the data should be retrieved, so DBMS takes care of all these features, as it maintains the uniformity of the database as well does the faster insertions as well as retrievals.

Why is RDBMS Required?

RDBMS on the other hand is a type of DBMS, as the name suggests it deals with relations as well as various key constraints. So here we have tables which are called schema and we have rows which are called tuples. It also aids in the reduction of data redundancy and the preservation of database integrity.

Relational Database Management System is an advanced version of a DBMS.
